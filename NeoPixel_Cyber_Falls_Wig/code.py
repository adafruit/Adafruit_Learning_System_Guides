# 'Cyber falls' sketch
# Creates a fiery rain-like effect on multiple NeoPixel strips.
# Requires Adafruit Trinket and NeoPixel strips.  Strip length is
# inherently limited by Trinket RAM and processing power; this is
# written for five 15-pixel strands, which are paired up per pin
# for ten 15-pixel strips total.
