projectDescription = "This diminutive dev board comes with our favorite lil chip, the SAMD21. OLEDs! Inertial Measurement Units! Sensors a-plenty. All plug-and-play thanks to the innovative chainable design: SparkFun Qwiic-compatible STEMMA QT connectors for the I2C bus so you don't even need to solder. It also has 11 GPIO pins and a built-in NeoPixel RGB LED. This board ships with CircuitPython but also works great with Arduino."
