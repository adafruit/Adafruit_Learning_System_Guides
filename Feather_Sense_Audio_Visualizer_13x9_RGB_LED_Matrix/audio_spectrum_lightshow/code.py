# FFT/SPECTRUM SETUP -----

# To keep the display lively, tables are precomputed where each column of
# the matrix (of which there are few) is the sum value and weighting of
# several bins from the FFT spectrum output (of which there are many).
# The tables also help visually linearize the output so octaves are evenly
# spaced, as on a piano keyboard, whereas the source spectrum data is
# spaced by frequency in Hz.
