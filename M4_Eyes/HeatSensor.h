/* Read the IR sensor and try to figure out where the heat is located. 

    Orientation: Looking into the sensor, the window is on the bottom of the silver package,
    and the Adafruit star is at the upper left.
    X goes from about -1.0 on the left, facing out of the sensor, to +1.0 on the right.
    Y goes roughly from -1.0 (less?) on the bottom to +1.0 on the top.
    The sensor is oriented with its text upside down for the moment.
    Magnitude is currently the maximum temperature of any pixel, in degrees C.
