while True: run this code
'sudo make me a sandwich'
good to the last byte

hot iron, cool bench
everything is organized
nirvana achieved

continuity?
the multimeter goes beep
testing continues

rainbow LEDs
blink and chase and undulate
example code.py

the printer makes noise
molten plastic is coming out
this never gets old

something big is coming
the soul of a new machine
abort, retry, fail?

The keyboard goes clack
writing code at 3AM
time for espresso!
