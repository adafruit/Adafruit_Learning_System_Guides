Data from https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/launches/next

Documentation for this API is at https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API. As this is a
non-SpaceX data source, accuracy and availability could be limited.

Note: The Lato-Bold-ltd-25.bdf font file only has the characters used in "Next SpaceX Launch" 
to save space on the MagTag flash drive. See the guide https://learn.adafruit.com/custom-fonts-for-pyportal-circuitpython-display/overview 
for building your own custom fonts for CircuitPython use on displays.
