# and it is possible to modify the example to use other fonts and non-standard
# characters.

# This next call creates the RGB Matrix object itself. It has the given width
# and height. bit_depth can range from 1 to 6; higher numbers allow more color
# shades to be displayed, but increase memory usage and slow down your Python
# code. If you just want to show primary colors plus black and white, use 1.
# Otherwise, try 3, 4 and 5 to see which effect you like best.

# These lines are for the Feather M4 Express. If you're using a different board,
# check the guide to find the pins and wiring diagrams for your board.
# If you have a matrix with a different width or height, change that too.
# If you have a 16x32 display, try with just a single line of text.

# Create two lines of text to scroll. Besides changing the text, you can also
# customize the color and font (using Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bitmap_Font).
# To keep this demo simple, we just used the built-in font.
# The Y coordinates of the two lines were chosen so that they looked good
# but if you change the font you might find that other values work better.
