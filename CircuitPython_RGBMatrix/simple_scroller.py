# and it is possible to modify the example to use other fonts and non-standard
# characters.

# and height. bit_depth can range from 1 to 6; higher numbers allow more color
# shades to be displayed, but increase memory usage and slow down your Python
# code. If you just want to show primary colors plus black and white, use 1.
# Otherwise, try 3, 4 and 5 to see which effect you like best.
