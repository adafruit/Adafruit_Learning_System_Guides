// CTC-DRA-13-1 ISOLATED DMX-RDM SHIELD JUMPER INSTRUCTIONS
//
// If you are using the above mentioned shield you should 
// place the RXEN jumper towards pin number 2, this allows the
// master controller to put to iso shield into transmit 
// (DMX Master) mode 
//
//
// The !EN Jumper should be either placed in the G (GROUND) 
// position to enable the shield circuitry 
//   OR
// if one of the pins is selected the selected pin should be
// set to OUTPUT mode and set to LOGIC LOW in order for the 
// shield to work
//


//
// The master will control 100 Channels (1-100)
// 
// depending on the ammount of memory you have free you can choose
// to enlarge or schrink the ammount of channels (minimum is 1)
//
#define DMX_MASTER_CHANNELS   100 

//
// Pin number to change read or write mode on the shield
//
#define RXEN_PIN                2


// Configure a DMX master controller, the master controller
// will use the RXEN_PIN to control its write operation 
// on the bus
DMX_Master        dmx_master ( DMX_MASTER_CHANNELS, RXEN_PIN );


// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {             
  
  // Enable DMX master interface and start transmitting
  dmx_master.enable ();  
  
  // Set channel 1 - 50 @ 50%
  dmx_master.setChannelRange ( 1, 25, 127 );
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() 
{
  static int dimmer_val;
  
  // Keep fading channel 1 in from 0 to 100%
  dmx_master.setChannelValue ( 1, dimmer_val++ );  
  
  delay ( 100 );
}
