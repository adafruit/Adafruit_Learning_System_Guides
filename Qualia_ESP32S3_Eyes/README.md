## Adafruit Learning System - M4_Eyes for the MONSTER M4SK

Make blinking, moving eyes on an Adafruit Monster M4sk microcontroller and display board.

This code is used for displaying realistic eyes on the Adafruit [Monster M4sk](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4343) board.

See the main [Adafruit Learning System tutorial on the Monster M4sk here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-monster-m4sk-eyes/overview).

Note the code is such that user code may be run with linitations - see user*.cpp. This method is used for a number of Adafruit Learning System guides to provide various functionality. As this is a rough form of task switching, not all actions will be compatible. There be dragons here and there is no guarantee of compatibility with all types of actions and hardware.
