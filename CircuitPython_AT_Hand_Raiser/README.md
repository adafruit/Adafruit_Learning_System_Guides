## Code for the Adafruit Learning System guide CircuitPython Powered AT Hand-Raiser

See the full tutorial at https://learn.adafruit.com/AT-Hand-Raiser/

The **code.py** file should be copied onto the **CIRCUITPY** flash drive that appears 
when you plug the CircuitPlayground Express into your computer via a known 
good USB cable. 

If the only drive name you get is named **CPLAYBOOT**, CircuitPython may not be loaded 
on the board. You can load CircuitPython as 
[per this guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/circuitpython-quickstart). 
Then you should be able to see the **CIRCUITPY** drive when connected via USB.
