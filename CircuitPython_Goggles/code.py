"""
NeoPixel goggles code for CircuitPython

With a rotary encoder attached (pins are declred in the "Initialize
hardware" section of the code), you can select animation modes and
configurable attributes (color, brightness, etc.). TAP the encoder
button to switch between modes/settings, HOLD the encoder button to
toggle between PLAY and CONFIGURE states.

With no rotary encoder attached, you can select an animation mode
and configure attributes in the "Configurable defaults" section
(including an option to auto-cycle through the animation modes).

Things to Know:
- FancyLED library is NOT used here because it's a bit too much for the
  Trinket M0 to handle (animation was very slow).
- Animation modes are all monochromatic (single color, varying only in
  brightness). More a design decision than a technical one...of course
  NeoPixels can be individual colors, but folks like customizing and the
  monochromatic approach makes it easier to select a color. Also keeps the
  code a bit simpler, since Trinket space & performance is limited.
- Animation is monotonic time driven; there are no sleep() calls. This
  ensures that animation is constant-time regardless of the hardware or
  CircuitPython performance over time, or other goings on (e.g. garbage
  collection), only the frame rate (smoothness) varies; overall timing
  remains consistent.
