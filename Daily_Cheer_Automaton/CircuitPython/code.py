# AUTOCHEER DEVICE
# code by Andy Doro
#
# plays an MP3 at a specific time.
#
# uses native CircuitPython mp3 playback
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
# should use M4 (or higher)
# use CircuitPython 5.3.0+
#
#
# HARDWARE:
# Feather M4 Express https://www.adafruit.com/product/3857
# Adalogger https://www.adafruit.com/product/2922
#
#
# TO DO
# ---
# - daylight saving time
# - use built-in NeoPixel as indicator
#

import time

# For hardware I2C (M0 boards) use this line:
import busio as io

# Or for software I2C (ESP8266) use this line instead:

# Use any pin that is not taken by SPI
# For Adalogger FeatherWing: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-adalogger-featherwing/pinouts
# The SDCS pin is the chip select line:
#    On ESP8266, the SD CS pin is on GPIO 15
#    On ESP32 it's GPIO 33
#    On WICED it's GPIO PB5
#    On the nRF52832 it's GPIO 11
#    On Atmel M0, M4, 328p or 32u4 it's on GPIO 10
#    On Teensy 3.x it's on GPIO 10
