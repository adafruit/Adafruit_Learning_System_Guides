Circuit Playground Bluefruit Ornament Proximity
This demo uses advertising to set the color of scanning devices depending on the strongest broadcast
signal received. Circuit Playgrounds can be switched between advertising and scanning using the
slide switch. The buttons change the color when advertising.
