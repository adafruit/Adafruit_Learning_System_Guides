### Code for the Adafruit Learning System guide<br>Bounce - an accelerometer game in Arduino for PyGamer and PyBadge

See the full tutorial at https://learn.adafruit.com/bounce-an-accelerometer-game-in-arduino-for-pygamer-and-pybadge

This file uses the Arduino IDE and the Adafruit Arcada game library (a superset of the Adafruit GFX display library). 
All the required libraries are listed at https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pybadge/arcada-libraries

Two files in the bounce directory: bounce.ino (the game) and logo.h (data for the Adafruit logo used on the splash screen). 
Load both into the Arduino IDE.
