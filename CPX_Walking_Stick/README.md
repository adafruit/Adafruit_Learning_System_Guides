## The Musical Walking Stick tutorial on the Adafruit Learning System

The code in this repo accompanies the Adafruit tutorial
Musical Walking Stick

The *appropriate code file file should be copied onto the **CIRCUITPY** flash drive as **code.py** that appears 
when you plug the CircuitPlayground Express into your computer via a known good USB cable. 

If the only drive name you get is named **CPLAYBOOT**, CircuitPython may not be loaded 
on the board. You can load CircuitPython [per this guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/circuitpython-quickstart). Then you should be able to see the **CIRCUITPY** drive when connected via USB.

CircuitPython resources may be found at https://CircuitPython.Org/
