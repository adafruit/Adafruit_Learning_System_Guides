# Adafruit LightSaber Overhaul

A modified version of the python code featured on : https://learn.adafruit.com/lightsaber-featherwing/overview

## Updated features
### Multi-channel audio 
  Allows the idle noise and active noise to play simultaneously. The buzz of the lightsaber does not stop like the original code
### Color Change
  Hold down power button for 2 seconds, when off, to engage color changing mode. Use second button to cycle colors. Hold again to disengage.
### Blaster Block SFX
  Press secondary button when power is on to play blaster noise.
### Sounds 
  I do not own any of these sounds, they were all found on free sound sites or A.I Generated.
