# Cyber Flower: Digital Valentine

# 'Roses are red,
#  Violets are blue,
#  This flower changes color,
#  To show its love for you.'
#
# Load this on a Gemma M0 running CircuitPython and it will smoothly animate
# the DotStar LED between different color hues.  Touch the D0 pad and it will
# cause the pixel to pulse like a heart beat.  You might need to also attach a
# wire to the ground pin to ensure capacitive touch sensing can work on battery
# power.  For example strip the insulation from a wire and solder it to ground,
# then solder a wire (with the insulation still attached) to D0, and wrap
# both wires around the stem of a flower like a double-helix.  When you touch
# the wires you'll ground yourself (touching the bare ground wire) and cause
# enough capacitance in the D0 wire (even though it's still insulated) to
# trigger the heartbeat.  Or just leave D0 unconnected to have a nicely
# animated lit-up flower!
#
# Note that on power-up the flower will wait about 5 seconds before turning on
# the LED.  During this time the board's red LED will flash and this is an
# indication that it's waiting to power on.  Place the flower down so nothing
# is touching it and then pick it up again after the DotStar LED starts
# animating.  This will ensure the capacitive touch sensing isn't accidentally
# calibrated with your body touching it (making it less accurate).
#
# Also note this depends on two external modules to be loaded on the Gemma M0:
#  - Adafruit CircuitPython DotStar:
# https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_DotStar
#  - Adafruit CircuitPython FancyLED:
# https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_FancyLED
#
# You _must_ have both adafruit_dotstar.mpy and the adafruit_fancyled folder
# and files within it on your board for this code to work!  If you run into
# trouble or can't get the dependencies see the main_simple.py code as an
# alternative that has no dependencies but slightly more complex code.
