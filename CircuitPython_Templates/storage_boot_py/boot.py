"""
CircuitPython Essentials Storage CP Filesystem boot.py file

There are three things to be updated in this file to match your board:
* Update OBJECT_NAME to match the physical thing you are using, e.g. button or pin.
* Update OBJECT_PIN to match the pin name to which the button or pin is attached.
* Update UP_OR_DOWN to match the Pull necessary for the chosen pin.

For example:
If using the up button on a FunHouse, update OBJECT_NAME to button, and OBJECT_PIN to BUTTON_UP.
If using pin A0 on a Feather RP2040, update OBJECT_NAME to pin, and OBJECT_PIN to A0.

For example:
If using the up button on a FunHouse, update UP_OR_DOWN to DOWN.
IF using pin A0 on a Feather RP2040, update UP_OR_DOWN to UP.
