# cpb-quick-draw v1.11
# CircuitPython (on CPBs) Quick Draw reaction game
# This is a two player game using two Circuit Playground Bluefruit boards
# to test the reaction time of the players in a "quick draw" with the
# synchronisation and draw times exchanged via Bluetooth Low Energy
# The switches must be set to DIFFERENT positions on the two CPBs

# Tested with Circuit Playground Bluefruit Alpha
# and CircuitPython and 5.0.0-beta.2

# Needs recent adafruit_ble and adafruit_circuitplayground.bluefruit libraries
