## Circuit Playground Bluefruit Quick Draw Duo tutorial on the Adafruit Learning System

The code in this repo accompanies the Adafruit tutorial

The Python code file should be copied onto the **CIRCUITPY** flash drive that appears 
when you plug the CircuitPlayground Express into your computer (via a known good USB cable) as **code.py**. 
Also copy the wav file for sound per the tutorial.

If the only drive name you get is named **CPLAYBTBOOT**, CircuitPython may not be loaded 
on the board. You can load CircuitPython [per this guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-bluefruit/circuitpython). 
Then you should be able to see the **CIRCUITPY** drive when connected via USB.

CircuitPython resources may be found at https://CircuitPython.Org/
