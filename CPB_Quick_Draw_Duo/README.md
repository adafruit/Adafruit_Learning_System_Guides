## Circuit Playground Bluefruit Quick Draw Duo tutorial on the Adafruit Learning System

The code in this repo accompanies the Adafruit tutorial
Circuit Playground Bluefruit Quick Draw Duo

The Python code file (code.py or reaction.py) should be copied onto the **CIRCUITPY** flash drive that appears 
when you plug the CircuitPlayground Express into your computer (via a known good USB cable) as **code.py**. 
Also copy the wav file for sound per the tutorial.

If the only drive name you get is named **CPLAYBTBOOT**, CircuitPython may not be loaded 
on the board. You can load CircuitPython [per this guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-bluefruit/circuitpython). 
Then you should be able to see the **CIRCUITPY** drive when connected via USB.

CircuitPython resources may be found at https://CircuitPython.Org/
